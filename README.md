# OrderAdjustmentBot

As part of my internship at Helpshift, I created a chatbot on Google DialogFlow from scratch. This involved: <br />
📝Writing a script for the bot to follow. For the cases of this bot, it was an order adjustment / fulfillment scenario. <br />
🗃Populating a test database, cluster, and collection on MongoDB <br />
🔗Creating a webhook to fulfill chatbot requests. To do this, I uploaded GET and POST requests to Heroku and deployed the code.

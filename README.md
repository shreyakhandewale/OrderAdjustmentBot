# OrderAdjustmentBot

As part of my internship at Helpshift, I created a chatbot on Google DialogFlow from scratch. This involved: 
📝Writing a script for the bot to follow. For the cases of this bot, it was an order adjustment / fulfillment scenario.
🗃Populating a test database, cluster, and collection on MongoDB
🔗Creating a webhook to fulfill chatbot requests. To do this, I uploaded GET and POST requests to Heroku and deployed the code.
